HeeksCNC is an open source CAD/CAM application.

Get the latest Windows version here http://www.heeks.net

Written in C++, HeeksCNC uses HeeksCAD http://code.google.com/p/heekscad/. The user can add machining operations. These can then be output to NC code. The NC code is then shown as red and green lines on the screen.
The NC code is generated using Python script, so it can be configured for different machines.

HeeksCNC uses OpenCAMLib for the 3D surface machining
HeeksCNC uses libarea for the "Pocket" operation
